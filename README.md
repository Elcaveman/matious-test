# Matious Test - FrontEnd

First of all I'm sorry that the FrontEnd doesn't look as good as it should be and the code is not as optimised as i want it to be. For the simple reason that the past 2 weeks were exam weeks so i only gave 4 hours of my time to make do this test.

## Instalation

Make sur to have nodeJS installed on your computer, then try to install angular CLI using 
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
Then try to change into the matious-front directory where the project resides
``` 
cd matious-front 
```
after that you need to insatll the dependencies
``` 
npm install 
```
then finaly you can serve the application via the command:
``` 
ng serve -o 
```
once the compilation is done you can access the application via localhost on port 4200
``http://localhost:4200/``
